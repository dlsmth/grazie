# Graz!e

Graz!e is quick little art project and prototype to explore ways to highlight positivity when you need it most - in times of negativity. One of a few apps ideas that originated from a simple conversation about wouldn't it be interesting if there was an app that... So I just went ahead and built it.

In essence, the app allows for daily entries of positive thoughts, on good days. The app then stores the entry, along with a timestamp into an array, saved on local storage. On bad days, when nothing is going right, a tap on the sad face icon pulls and displays an entry at random, as a simple reminder that good days do exist and will come again. I chose to store the data locally, partly out of simplicity and speed, but also because I feel that data really only needs to live on the user's phone. Local storage will be deleted if not accessed for about a week, so it's a good incentive to keep making new entries, daily - one of the key elements of mindfulness.

Super fast build, via concurrent design+development, from idea to implementation... about a Saturday morning & afternoon.
